👋 Hi, I’m Mamun Hsn - Product Analyst at Swiggy

Data Scientist | Product & Business Analytics | Machine Learning Enthusiast

Results-oriented Data Scientist with 3+ year of hands-on experience across Data Science, Business Analysis, and Product Support. I enjoy doing things the tried-and-true way: understand the problem deeply, clean the data properly, explore thoroughly, then model thoughtfully—no shortcuts, no magic tricks 🎩.

I’ve worked closely with business stakeholders to translate real-world problems into data-driven solutions, from customer segmentation and churn prediction to demand forecasting and sentiment analysis. Currently, I’m working as a Product Executive Support at Swiggy, where I focus on data configuration, validation, and analytics workflows to ensure accuracy and impact.

🔧 What I work with
	•	Languages & Tools: Python, SQL, Excel
	•	Data & ML: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, EDA, Statistics, Hypothesis Testing
	•	Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Ensemble Models, PCA
	•	Deep Learning & NLP: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, OCR (Tesseract)
	•	Visualization & Deployment: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

🚀 What I’ve built
	•	End-to-end ML projects for customer segmentation, churn prediction, and recommendations
	•	Predictive analytics on Brazilian e-commerce (OLIST dataset)
	•	NLP models for review classification and sentiment analysis
	•	Dashboards and insights for both technical and non-technical stakeholders

📚 Mindset
Curious by nature, disciplined by practice. I believe good models come from good questions, and great insights come from respecting the data. Always learning, always refining—like polishing an old tool until it shines ✨.
